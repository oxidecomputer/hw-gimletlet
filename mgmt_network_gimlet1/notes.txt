VSC 8552 - dual SGMII PHY?
KSZ8463FRL - media converter? 3 port switch
	LQFP-64_10x10mm_P0.5mm footprint exists



ice40 rails:
	Bank 0+1 VCCIO
	Bank 2+3 VCCIO (LVDS pairs here)
	SPI VCCIO (unused? check if needed w/ NVCM) - yes, needed
	VPP_FAST - MUST connect to VCCIO_0
	VCC - 1.2V, 6.4 mA MAX (15.7 mA compat)
	VPP_2V5 - 2.5V, 7.7 mA MAX (compat)
	VCCPLL - 1.2V, 1.5 mA MAX (8 mA compat)


KSZ8463FRL rails:
	VDD_IO - ? V, 98 mA (typical)
		"if VDDIO is 1.8V, use external VDD_L"
	VDD_L - internal or external, connect to VDD_AL, VDDCOL
	VDD_COL - connect to VDD_L
	VDD_AL - connect to VDD_L
	VDD_A3.3 - 3.3V, 51 mA (typical)

VSC8552 rails:
	VDD25A - 2.5V, 265 mA MAX
	VDD25 - 2.5V, 65 mA MAX
	VDD1 - 1V, 755 mA MAX
	VDD1A - 1V, 265 mA MAX


input power - 12V, 2A

Rails:
12V 2A = 24W
1.2V ~24 mA
2.5V >330 mA
1V ~1A - check the tolerances here, very tight

Preliminary proposal - buck to 3.3V, linear down to 1.2, 1, 2.5
	might split 1 and 1A for current reasons
Total Iout for buck - <2A
	TPS82140?
1V LDO - TLV757P - only option in SOT23 @ 1A @ 1V
1.2V LDO - TLV700 - cheap SC70 option @ 1.2V


refclks:
	VSC8552 - 125 or 25 MHz, AC coupled, LVDS
		can be SE with circuit described in datasheet
	KSZ8463FRL - 25 or 50 MHz, XTAL or osc, single-ended CMOS
	ice40 - literally whatever lol
LMK1C1103 1:3 output buffer? need input but would be good

18002441111


power sequencing
KSZ - recommend all at once, if not, A3.3 and VDDIO have no requirement but come before L (irrelevant)
vsc - no sequencing requirement but power and clock must be stable before releasing reset
lp4k - when configuring from NVCM, VCC and VPP2V5 must be up 0.25ms before VCCSPI, but maybe not if between 0.4 and 10 V/ms
	UP and LM both require VCC+VCCPLL to come up before VCCIO

who's on what rail?

3.3V - only VDD_A3.3 on KSZ, and all the linear regs
2.5V - VDD_IO on KSZ, VDD25+VDD25A on VSC, VCCIO+VPP_2V5+VCCIO_SPI(?) on LP4K
1.2V - VCC+VCCPLL on LP4K
1.0V - VDD1+VDD1A on VSC8552

2 mA sink on PG implies Rpu of 1.65k or more
EN thresholds - 0.9V for TLV700, 1V for TLV757

.31845374111 = t / RC

so .32 time constants to rise to 0.9V from 3.3V

if t = 250 us and R = 10kOhm, C = 78 nF
if R = 10kOhm and C = 100 nF, t = 318 microseconds or so


arright there's no sequencing req because the requirements are contradictory.

3V3 investigation - major point of issue is the SMI lines (shared, DC coupled).

VIH for CMOS inputs on KSZ is 2.1V @ 3.3V
redo the pull-up math
MDIO is push-pull, MDC is sourced from master (STM32) - check if VSC can handle it
VSC is max 3.3V, so should be fine - MDC is explicitly marked 3V tolerant
STM32 i/o VIH is 2.31V min (CMOS) at 3.3V. i call it good.

new target - 0.9987 in

left to right - 30, 31, 20, 21, 10, 11, 00, 01
left to right - 5, 4, 11, 10, 9, 12, 8, 13, clk2, clk1 (0 and 1 whereever)


aux - bias the receiver?
