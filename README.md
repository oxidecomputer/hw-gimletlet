# hw-gimletlet
More full-featured breakout board for the STM32H7, including many expansion headers for daughter boards. 

In active use for Hubris development and as a Swiss Army Knife around the lab.  Generally
when someone is speaking about a "gimletlet" the mean gimletlet2 "Glorified Gimletlet" as
a *vanishingly* small number of gimletlet1's were built and used for some very early network
bring-up.
